    <h1>Forgive Yourself</h1><hr>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>With work that ranges from the laugh out loud funny to the silence and rage of loss, Forgive Yourself These Tiny Acts of Self-Destruction is a must read.<br>
        This is a collection of work that asks itself for forgiveness while becoming an instruction manual on how readers can follow suit. These complex and passionate poems make space for a narrative about the self in the wake of destruction.<br>
        It explores American culture and examines how Singers identity as a Jewish American underpins daily life. This book tells us that forgiveness has the power to grant a release from the shame we carry about our decisions. Forgive Yourself was written from a place of vulnerability and pushes us towards compassion for the person we are with the most, ourselves.  </p>
